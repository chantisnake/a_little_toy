# a_little_toy
this is just a little toy I created to change name into name of the element

## what is this

this program can change people's name into the closet cobination of elements

element table stored in the file 'read', you can change the content in order to change what consist of you name.

* caution: the program use the first element of each line to 'read' to make you name

* caution: although I don't think anything terrible will happen because of this, but I recommend to seperate your input in the 
'read' seperate with only one space.


## how to run

if you are using a linux just clone this in the root and run

    python 3.py
  
if you are using windows or mac, make sure you have python 3.4, and you can use the same command.

## how I get the idea

Inpired by my RA, she label each room with our name consist of elements

And also, Fiona, my schoolmate, said that if I finish this she will rate me the second adorable Chinese Boy in the class of 2018,
<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">although we only have like 6 Chinese boy in the class of 2018 ...</span>
